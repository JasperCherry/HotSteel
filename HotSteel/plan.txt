 ////single player only

to do:



///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

artillery 3xupgrades after campaign

sounds for menu acctions

more interesting menu graphics, shadow or sth

upgrades, achievements and cash as cookie

tanks ai collsion with rocks avoidance

when player is killed, waiting few seconds

better cannon bullet detection, so it cannot shoot over rocks / tanks from small distance.
- bullet doesnt show its flame, move flame back, only after some time of leaving barrel bullet shows flame





/////////////////extra :



counting web visits


controls might be overcomplicated 
(maybe switching weapons? can reduce controls and help in multiplayer)

////////////////// point of the game

30% - extras

70% - artillery
