 ////single player only

to do:



///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

artillery 3xupgrades after campaign
- shots in tanks on map far from player, if no tanks, random points far from player.
- can randomly destroy dead tank

sounds for menu acctions

more interesting menu graphics, shadow or sth

upgrades, achievements and cash as cookie

tanks ai collsion with rocks avoidance

when player is killed, waiting few seconds

better cannon bullet detection, so it cannot shoot over rocks / tanks from small distance.
- bullet doesnt show its flame, move flame back,
 only after some time of leaving barrel bullet shows flame
- bullet position is being moved and checked by the loop in bullet control,
 or by bullet update function in it, with smaller distance, closer detection
